Hello Go
========

This is me playing around with what Golang can do. Really just learning the language.

I guess it's also a potential reddit CLI?  Because that's what the world needs. Right?

Usage
=====

First:

```bash
go install hellogo #Or whatever folder you clone it to
```

Then: 
```bash
hellogo golang

#reddit stories printed here
```
